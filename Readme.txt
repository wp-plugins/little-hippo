Little Hippo is a multifunction plugin for agencies and site owners that speeds up the process
of onsite optimisation.

== Description ==

Little Hippo is a Multifunction plugin for agencies and site owners that speeds up the process 
of onsite optimisation. By bringing the page Meta and image Meta into a single area you can 
fly through the mark-up process.

We have included a quick look dashboard that allows you to see at a glance, any on-site issues 
that you may have, without having to run a scan at all. It gives you an instant idea on how 
much work you have ahead of you.

We have also added some of the most important settings you need for a site into one place. 
With a single click you can make all outgoing links no follow, an easy to use tabbed default 
title and naming convention, and we have beefed up the Google Analytics input, giving you 
the ability to edit the bounce rate time out in seconds.

We have many more features coming, in new iterations, like page and site speed edits, CDN 
management, Redirect management, robots and HT access management, webmaster tools notifications 
and much more.

Little hippo will be the first and last SEO plugin that you will need to install on any site!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this work with the newest version of wordpress? =
We ensure that this is built to the newest build of WP (4.0) and will continue to update it

= Does Little Hippo work with other SEO Plug-ins? =
Yes, we have written Little Hippo so it will work with either All-in-one SEO or (Yoast) 
WordPress SEO. This way, you do not need to re-enter any of your data or settings if you are 
currently using either of these plug-ins. 
In an upcoming release, we will offer the ability to copy your data from your existing 
plug-in into Little Hippo.

= Will this work with all themes? =
We have built it to work with the WordPress core, not the theme so you will have hassle 
free integration. However, some themes provide their own SEO components. These may conflict 
with any values input in Little Hippo.

= Why do the titles not show on all the images when I run a test on the site? =
WordPress Core removed the default alt and title Meta a few versions ago, and while we provide 
the option to add the titles to every image, WordPress doesn’t natively show that data. If you 
know php and HTML we recommend you update your theme to show this data. 
For some hints and recommendations, please look the user guide ** Coming Soon **

= The home page meta default isn’t showing! =
If you have Yeost or All in one SEO, the settings for home page will be controlled form there, 
in V2 and 3 we plan to move all the important functions into Little Hippo so you will not even 
need to use these other plugins.

= Why are Meta Title / Meta Desc fields highlighted as red? =
If you have posts/pages that have not had a Meta Title or a Meta Desc defined, Little Hippo 
will suggest values for you. Little Hippo creates a default title from the post/page title 
and a description from the first 155 characters of the content. If these values have not been 
aved, Little Hippo will highlight the input field as read, indicating that you must save these 
values to accept them before they will be displayed on your website for search engines.

= Can we hire you to do our SEO? =
Yes of course, please contact us and we can discuss how we can help!
