== Description ==

Little Hippo is a Multifunction plugin for agencies and site owners that speeds up the process 
of onsite optimisation. By bringing the page Meta, image Meta into a single area you can fly 
through the mark-up process.

We have included a quick look dashboard that allows you to see at a glance issues with your 
onsite issues, without having to run a scan at all, it gives you an instant idea on how much 
work you have ahead of you.

We have also added the some of the most important settings you need for a site into one place, 
with a single click to make all outgoing links no follow, an easy to use tabbed default title 
and naming convention, and we have beefed up the google analytics input, giving you the 
ability to edit the bounce rate time out in seconds.

We have many more features coming, in new iterations, like page and site speed edits, cdn 
management, Redirect management, robots and HT access management, webmaster tools notifications 
and much more.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this work with the newest version of wordpress? =
We ensure that this is built to the newest build of WP (4.0) and will continue to update it

= Will this work with all themes? =
Yes, we have built it to work with the WordPress core, not the theme so you will have hassle 
free integration

= Why do the titles not show on all the images when I run a test on the site? =
WordPress Core removed the default alt and title Meta a few versions ago, and while we provide 
the option to add the titles to every image, WordPress doesn’t natively show that data. If you 
know php and HTML we recommend you update your theme to show this data. 
For some hints and recommendations, please look to this guide here (*//TODO*)

= The home page meta default isn’t showing! =
If you have Yeost or All in one SEO, the settings for home page will be controlled form there, 
in V2 and 3 we plan to move all the important functions into Little Hippo so you will not even 
need to use these other plugins. 

= Can we hire you to do our SEO? =
Yes of course, please contact us and we can discuss how we can help!
